# Bohnenspeil-Agent
Bohnenspeil Game Playing Agent

This contains the AI agent I wrote for my final project for the McGill artificial intelligence course (COMP 424).

It won first place in the class tournament.

The actual code is in Code. The code for simulating the game, GUI, game client/server were provided. The actual bot I ended up submitting is in Code/src/student_player/StudentPlayer.java
