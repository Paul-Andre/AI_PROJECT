# Bohnenspeil-Agent
Bohnenspeil Game Playing Agent

This contains the AI agent I wrote for my final project for the McGill artificial intelligence course (COMP 424 Winter 2017). *DO NOT COPY*

It won first place in the class tournament.

The actual code is in Code. The code for simulating the game, GUI, game client/server were provided and is in Code. The actual bot code I ended up submitting is in [Code/src/student_player/StudentPlayer.java](https://github.com/Paul-Andre/Bohnenspeil-Agent/blob/master/Code/src/student_player/StudentPlayer.java). The code in the other folders was things I tried that did not get used in the end.
